# Intro to HTML5 Games in Phaser

what is Phaser

link to GSWP

TLDR

  Server 
  final app
  basic app template

  run it in a server
    - XAMP
    - Python

  livereload
    - node
    - ruby

  Text Editor
    - Sublime Text
    - Anything that supports JS

Brief runthrough of template

  - tweaked template from /path
  - explain app.js

Game Loop Pattern

  - why "render" & "update"
  - (optional) RiceGrowJS
  - (optional) WDFAC
  - Update - sprite tileset
  - empty render

# Sprites, Animation, and Basic Physics

- skip preload / main menu

Draw bullet sprite 

Draw Enemy animation

move bullet via update

Anchor

Add code for collision 

 - Debug mode
 - overlap code
 - overlap callback
 - explosion!!
 - sfx

# Player Controls

Draw Player

Move using keyboard

Move using touch

- caveat wiggle

Add info text on how to play

Fire Bullets

- fire rate
- sfx
- memory consumption...

# Sprite Groups

Convert bullets into Sprite Group

Convert explosion into Sprite Group

Create Sprite Group for Enemy

Randomize Enemy Spawn

Death on Player bump
-hitbox reduce

+ bug sprite vs group

# Health, Score, and Win/Lose Conditions

Tougher Enemies

- damage

Add Score

Lives

  - scaled sprite

  - invulnerable time

  - refactor -> hit by bullet?

Win/Lose Conditions

  - Win when you reach 10000 points
    - destroy all enemies (boom!)

  - Lose when you don't have any more life

# Expanding our Game

Shooting Enemy Type

  - full copy paste

  rotating + debug

Increasing Difficulty



The Boss

  - form = 0
  - form = 1 Approaching, invulnerable

  - form = 2
    Bounce!
    Shooting!

  - Big explosion on death!

  - change win condition

# Wrapping Up


- What we didn't cover

  - mobile
    - packaging
  - other physics engines
  - and much more!

- Challenge!
  - different pdf
